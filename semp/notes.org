* DONE load geometries
* DONE load rel.dat
* DONE load params
* DONE dump params
* DONE write a gaussian file
* TODO write all the gaussian files needed for a step
* TODO call gaussian directly, run this on a node
  - eventually request multiple cpus and run in parallel
* TODO assemble Jacobian matrix from repeated calls to gaussian
  - might start with forward differences
* TODO matrix math to get new params
  - use gonum, permissive license confirmed
* TODO repeat
* WAIT acquire atom labels
  - hard-code for now, load from somewhere later
  - probably from params file
  - or read an input file directly and run the initial params run for
    the user
