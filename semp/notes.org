I need a little more info about Gaussian itself on Maple. Do I need to
make separate directories for each column? Can I just invoke the g16
command and write its stdin from memory?

#+begin_src go
  var buf bytes.Buffer
  cmd := exec.Command("g16")
  cmd.Stdin = WriteCom()
  cmd.Stdout = buf
#+end_src

or something like that. What I do know is that I need to prepare
input, give it to g16 and parse the output for the energy. The
energies for each geometry for a given parameter set give a column in
the jacobian.

* IDEA try only keeping nonzero params
  - should really reduce the number considered
  - trying this out
* having trouble with singular matrix
  - might be too many params for the number of energies, not a unique
    solution
  - retrying with 24 geometries to the 23 params
  - stll not helping, trying removing gcore and then I'm going to try
    adjusting the step size again
    - gcore did not help, back to smaller step size
    - the condition number did get a bit smaller, but not sufficiently
      so to make it not an error
  - could be singular because I'm not taking out terms that relate to
    each other, might have to parse more carefully
    - for example 1,2 param vs 2,1 should not be independent
* DONE load geometries
* DONE load rel.dat
* DONE load params
* DONE dump params
* DONE write a gaussian file
* TODO write all the gaussian files needed for a step
  - mostly done, need to test
  - I think this is viewing it backwards, I need to have the matrix
    first imo
* TODO call gaussian directly, run this on a node
  - mostly done need to test in real life
  - eventually request multiple cpus and run in parallel
  - do I need to set up all the scratch dir stuff? or can I just call
    in the current directory
* DONE assemble Jacobian matrix from repeated calls to gaussian
  - I think this is done, pending a good SEnergy implementation
* TODO matrix math to get new params
  - use gonum, permissive license confirmed
* TODO compute and print rmsd to log file
  - also compute one initially
* TODO repeat
* WAIT acquire atom labels
  - hard-code for now, load from somewhere later
  - probably from params file
  - or read an input file directly and run the initial params run for
    the user
* Units
  Gaussian outputs the semi-empirical energies in AU, so I think I
  don't have to do any conversions
* Actually don't have to keep writing the input file to stdin
  - the geometries stay the same, only params change, so I could
    actually write files and keep using them
